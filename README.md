```
I'm snoring It's boring
I'm not regretting
I was born
But it's not like the life
I have wanted  all the time
Well, even if life changes,
I won't realize my heart that
beating fast
So I am going to realize
I have been lazy,
I have been lazy
Recently,
world is a bit hard to live
I have been crazy, now
let's just say"It's good to be
alive!"
Sighing's not fun,
whistle instead
I don't know why
I love this way
But it makes me smile little
more
Sighing's not fun,
whistle instead
I don't know why
I love this way
But it makes me smile little
more
I'm skipping my boring day
Hoping I can jump out
to a brand-new world
I'm snoring It's boring
I'm not regretting
I was born
But it's not like the life
I have wanted  all the time
Well, even if life changes,
I won't realize my heart that
beating fast
So I am going to realize
I have been lazy,
I have been lazy
Recently,
world is a bit hard to live
I have been crazy, now
let's just say"It's good to be
alive!"
Sighing's not fun,
whistle instead
I don't know why
I love this way
But it makes me smile little
more
Sighing's not fun,
whistle instead
I don't know why
I love this way
But it makes me smile little
more
I'm skipping my boring day
Hoping I can jump out
to a brand-new world
I'm skipping my boring day
Hoping I can jump out
to a brand-new world
